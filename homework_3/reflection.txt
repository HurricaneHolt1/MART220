I find trying to create art with code to be an interesting challenge. I often get a vision of what I want to create and then struggle to find the technical skills to pull it off. Asking AI where I am going wrong is a huge help, but then I wonder sometimes at what point does the creative process really end and the technical process takes over. Using AI to create anything is also an interesting challenge that requires precise wording and some skill. I feel that true knowledge of a topic allows the user to know what to ask AI and how to get the most out of it for tasks in their field. It is nice to have all of this creative power at our fingertips, but without taking the time to learn the fundementals and techniques used we will miss out on all these tools can do.
