This week I was playing catch up at first after being hit with the flu bug. I was able to finish up last week project, but was unable to turn in due to being past the due date. This weekend I was able to work on homework 4 and got most of the items there but did not get it looking very good. While working on it this morning a fire broke out in my sons room. We got the fire out, but he had to be airlifted to Salt Lake City for surgery and just got out of his first surgery. My hand was burnt while putting out the fire but I wanted to make sure to turn what I had completed in. AI helped figure out some coding hangups and helped me get my scene looking kinda cool last week.
