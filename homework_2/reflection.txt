I think that the creative differences between myself and AI are not easy to see in this activity, due to my difficulty expressing my mind with p5 currently. The AI picture of a forest scene has much more detail and artistry. The forest scene I created was simple and a bit more abstract than the image created by ChatGPT. My art was more playful and childlike while AI made a more highly detailed picture. AI knows how to create just about anything, and the difficulty is getting the prompt just right to create exactly what you want. There is more guesswork and word games involved in creation rather than skill building. Human created art lets creativity out in a much more natural way and builds the skills to continue expressing yourself in new ways. While AI can be a great tool for creation it can be a stumbling block in learning how to truly express your own creativity.
